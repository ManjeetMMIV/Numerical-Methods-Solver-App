 Numerical Methods Solver Web App
This project is a web-based calculator that allows users to numerically solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the Modified Euler Method. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it runs completely in the browser—no libraries or backend dependencies required.

⚙️ Features
Accepts user input for:

Initial condition x₀, y₀

Step size h

Function f(x, y)

Number of steps n

Computes iterative solutions using the Modified Euler Method

Displays results in a step-by-step format

Provides a simple, responsive, and intuitive user interface

Works entirely offline and without any external libraries

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
HTML – For the structure and layout of the app

CSS – For styling and responsive design

JavaScript – To implement the numerical algorithm and dynamic UI behavior

📈 Outcome
